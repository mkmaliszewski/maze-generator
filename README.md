# maze-generator

maze-generator is a java project that, as the name suggests, generates mazes. There are three different algorithms implemented to achieve that goal - recursive backtracker, randomized Prim's and hunt-and-kill. Choosing which one should be used comes to uncommenting it in a MazeGenerator class constructor, as well as leaving the other two options commented. The project also tries to solve the generated maze - it uses simple method that marks every path to the starting point and then after finding the exit, it tracks back to the beginning marking that exact way. The last step is painting the generated maze (white paths) and the way to the exit (yellow path). The variable "size" keeps the information about the size of a maze and increasing it causes the maze to be generated with more possible paths, which also means that the difficulty gets harder.
